# Disclose
Disclose seeks to be the Facebook Connect of Blockchain. It leverages Zero Knowledge Proof schemes to ensure consistency and trust in the provided data while hiding them to the rest of the world.

It provides:

* Private: Trade tokens without revealing to everyone who you are
* Crosschain reusability: As simple as Facebook connect for the blockchain
* Minimal: Answer compliance requirements with as much as a 0 or 1
* Auditable: Only the authorized people can access the underlying data upon request

__More information is available on the whitepaper in Github.__ The current implementation is a pure PoC, not ready for production. In case of additional interest in the project, more efficient protocols would be implemented.

The two videos are meant to explain the data validation part generated by the user for the authority and the second while not integrated within a filtered as suggested by 0x in their compliant peer to peer trading blog post, show the validation of the snark onchain.

Videos are available on Youtube:

Data transfer and signature by authority: __https://youtu.be/_pMUf6ox3vY__

Contract interaction: __https://youtu.be/vghPIw6t_JU__

The contract is available on Rinkeby on the following address: __0xFBA7Bc3EA5A16246844D730a6168Af4A96373aA3__

The code is available in deployment/contract and the test inputs are available in deployment.

Thanks for Circom, SnarkJS for providing most of the tooling and for 0x and Coin list for providing an opportunity to try them out.
